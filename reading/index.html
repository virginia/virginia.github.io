          Last night I went to the launch of Peter Mendelsund's two books, <em>Cover</em> and <em>What We See When We Read</em>. This is a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/portrait-cover-artist-interview-peter-mendelsund">nice little interview</a> with him in the New Yorker. It's a shame that the meta-cover idea for the Calvino jackets didn't get up. There's also <a href="http://bombmagazine.org/article/1000223/peter-mendelsund">this</a> in Bomb.

          When I read <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/israels-other-war">this</a> article on the subway, I was acutely aware of the people around me who would have objected to its premise.

          The freshly-shucked New Yorker archives are an extraordinary bounty. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/24/the-deepest-dive">The Deepest Dive</a> is a gripping sports story about a <em>woman</em>, of all things.
