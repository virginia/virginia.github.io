          Been in Clevetown for the week, working hard. Smashed through Michael Cunningham's latest, <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/media/1474870/the-snow-queen">The Snow Queen</a> on the trips to and fro – some beautiful passages of writing, but the characters lack real depth. This really resonated though:
          <blockquote>
            Ahead of them looms the vast limestone bulk of the Metropolitan Museum, its stern, familiar brightness. Barrett thinks, as he always does when he approaches the museum, of what lies within: a more-than-adequate sampling of every instance in which human beings were inspired to do more than human beings can technically do, whether it's the summoning of life from the stubborn inanimacy of paint and canvas, or the hammering of gold into reliquary saints with ecstatic and tortured faces the size of dimes.

          The Sopranos is sublime – I've just smashed through the first series again while tooling around the house on my own. And for what it's worth, I don't think it matters whether <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/8/27/6006139/did-tony-die-at-the-end-of-the-sopranos">Tony died or not</a>, but it's <em>definitely</em> ambiguous.

          From <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/25/seeds-of-doubt">this New Yorker article</a> about Vandana Shiva, and the controversy surrounding her absolutist attitude to genetically modified crops:
          <blockquote>
            Sustaining [ten billion] people will require farmers to grow more food in the next seventy-five years than has been produced in all of human history.
          </blockquote>
          I am guilty of having received and passed on the 'suicide seeds' story myself, and I'm embarrassed to have done so without further investigation. As always, the story is much more nuanced.

          Actually, it seems like the practicalities and politics of food production are having a bit of a Moment this week: a quick look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hGP_MyZq8U&index=1&list=PL39u5ZEfYDEOTY2tmPqNONnENLPB5NORu&utm_content=buffer8acb8">MIT's aeroponics lab</a>, high-tech plant protein and in vitro meat in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/sunday-review/rethinking-eating.html?smid=tw-share">Rethinking Eating</a>, and Alice Waters <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/talk-to-al-jazeera/interviews-and-more/2013/11/22/alice-waters-andaljazeeraamericasdavidshuster.html?nl=cooking&em_pos=large&emc=edit_ck_20140827">interviewed on Al Jazeera</a> (she comes off sounding a bit naive, to be honest, although I love her restaurant and recipes).

          Last night I went to the launch of Peter Mendelsund's two books, <em>Cover</em> and <em>What We See When We Read</em>. This is a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/portrait-cover-artist-interview-peter-mendelsund">nice little interview</a> with him in the New Yorker. It's a shame that the meta-cover idea for the Calvino jackets didn't get up. There's also <a href="http://bombmagazine.org/article/1000223/peter-mendelsund">this</a> in Bomb.
